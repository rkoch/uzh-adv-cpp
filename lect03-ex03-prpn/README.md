Lecture 03, Exercise 03, pRPN
=============================

This exercise was to improve the Reverse Polish Notation Calculator
to use the previously implemented pvector datatype.

Important note
--------------

This project might not work outside of eclipse as it depends on the pvector which
is referenced through some eclipse settings instead of a correct Makefile.
