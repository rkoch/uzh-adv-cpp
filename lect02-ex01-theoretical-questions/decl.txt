Exercise 2.1
------------

char ch;
  Source file, looks to me more like a local variable declaration (because of the naming)
  Also possible in the header file obviously
  
string s;
  Source file, looks to me more like a local variable declaration (because of the naming)
  Also possible in the header file obviously

extern int error_number;
  Header file, external declaration

static double sq(double);
  Header file, function declaration

int count = 1;
  Source file, looks to me more like a local variable definition
  Also possible in the header file obviously

const double pi = 3.5;
  Header file, constant definition

struct fraction { int c; int d; }
  Source file, Struct definition

struct user;
  Header file, Struct declaration

char* name = "It's me";
  Source file, variable definition (contained in methods/functions)

char* prog[] = { "echo", "hello", "world!", NULL };
  Source file, variable definition (contained in methods/functions)

extern "C" void c_swap(int* a, int* b);
  Header file, external declaration

double sqrt(double);
  Header file, function declaration

void swap(int &a, int &b) { int c = a; a = b; b = c; }
  Source file, function definition
